Christmas g  Grammys 2014 : 
 of a sweltering southern Ontario summer , thousands of kilometres and two time zones away from Sports Authority Field at Mile High in Denver , Andrew Yearwood received a tap on the shoulder .  A tap that made him cry for joy .  It was the 2013 Scarborough Thunder alumni day at Birch mount Stadium , a festival celebrating the area 's youth football . There were games being played on the field while food and T-shirts were being sold on the grounds , part of the events honouring the sport at the grass roots level .  Yearwood was enjoying all of it . Then came the tap . And the subsequent words :  " How are you doing , coach ? Great to see you . "  Yearwood looked up and saw a behemoth of a man standing there , a 6-7 , 330-foot physical specimen who looked as if he was put on the face of the Earth to play football .  To the rest of the world , this gentle giant was known as Orlando Franklin , right tackle of the Denver Broncos           quarterback Peyton Manning .  But to Andrew Yearwood , this was the guy nicknamed " Brooklyn , " the bespectacled kid he had coached as a teenager for two years with the Scarborough Thunder .  This was the same Brooklyn who had been trying to straighten out his life after two earlier stints in a juvenile detention facility .  The same Brooklyn who often did not have enough bus fare to get to practice or games , causing Yearwood and his fellow coaches to buy him TTC tickets or give him rides .  The same Brooklyn who has overcome all that adversity and is now an NFL starter .  Given all that , the emotions of the moment were just too strong for Yearwood to contain .  " Tears came to my eyes when I saw him that day , " Yearwood recalled during a phone interview on Monday .  " I told him how proud I was of him . We all are . He is just so humble . "  On that day , Franklin told Yearwood about life in           a practical joker .  He also asked about some of the kids on hand who came from poor backgrounds as he had .  Recalled Yearwood : " It was like he never left . "  For those like Yearwood and Paul Blackwood who were involved in Franklin 's development in the Toronto area both as a football player and as a man , this is a special week . One of their prized students will be seen by millions upon millions of television viewers when the Broncos and Seattle Seahawks step onto the field at MetLife Stadium on Sunday for Super Bowl XLVIII . And it is men like these two who fully understand and appreciate just what an accomplishment this is .  Franklin , 26 , will get his first dose of Super Bowl reality on Tuesday when the circus known as Media Day takes place at the Prudential Centre in downtown Newark .  Given his sudden celebrity status , he can expect a fair number of questions , especially from the Canadian media .  Then , come Sunday , there will           the Sports Building of Seneca College 's Newnham Campus Student Centre from 6 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. . Broncos’ orange-and-blue will be the theme of the day for attendees . Go to for more info .  You can bet Paul Blackwood will be there in support of Brooklyn .  Blackwood played six years as a fullback in the CFL with Winnipeg , Toronto and B.C. After he retired , he helped kids with a passion for sports and life as part of the Academy of Learning Strength and Conditioning ( ALSC ) , a Scarborough-based outfit that provided enlightenment about things such as scouting and education .  One of Blackwood 's one-time students ? Brooklyn .  " When I see him now , he reminded me of a lot of kids today we deal with who come from similar tough backgrounds , " Blackwood said late Monday evening from Toronto .  " The difference is that Brooklyn made the decision himself that he was going to make something of his life . That’s why it’s so great when he comes back           : ' If I can make it , so can you . '  " Before he left for the U.S. to pursue his football dreams , I started an off-season program . He was about 6-foot-6 , 270 lbs . at the time . I could see potential . He’s the one who made it happen .  " When I see him , I see a Scarborough guy . More importantly , when I see him , I see a lot of hope for other kids . "  Having said that , when some of Franklin 's former coaches such as Andrew Yearwood and Paul Blackwood see Brooklyn take to the field for the Super Bowl on Sunday , they might even she 'd an emotional tear .

 ATLANTA- A rare ice storm turned Atlanta into a slippery mess on Wednesday , stranding thousands for hours on frozen roadways and raising questions about how city leaders prepared for and handled the cold snap that slammed the U.S. South .  The storm , which has killed at least seven people , on Tuesday swept over a region of about 60 million largely unaccustomed to ice and snow - stretching from Texas through Georgia and into the Carolinas - and forecasts called for more freezing weather on Thursday .  Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed came under fire for his response to a storm that trapped hundreds of children in schools overnight , some without provisions , and created traffic jams stretching for miles on roads coated with two inches of snow .  " Folks are angry with the mayor of Atlanta , with the governor , " said Flavia DiCesare , 54 , who spent the night in her office at Cox Enterprises in Atlanta , about 30 miles from home .  The mayor said schools , businesses and government offices were partly to blame for sending all           .  " During the day , we have a million to 1.2 million people in this city and all those people were out in very bad weather . It hampered our ability to get our equipment on the ground and to prepare our roads for that , " Reed told a news conference .  " The error - and we have shared responsibility for the error - the error was letting everybody out at once , " he said .  Georgia Governor Nathan Deal said all of Atlanta 's school children had been safely returned to their families by Wednesday evening , with help from the National Guard and State Patrol .  The one-day snowfall of 2.6 inches ranked as the 20th heaviest in Atlanta , which has recorded a daily snowfall of an inch or more 55 times since 1928 , according to the National Weather Service .  The city 's highways became parking lots and thousands of motorists , still stuck 24 hours after the storm hit , were seeking help and food . Workers who could not get home were setting up           , littered with stranded cars , looked like a scene from the television show " Walking Dead " , said DiCesare , who spent the night in her office with about 100 other employees .  " It looks like zombies walking on the side of these roads , " she said .  About 800 traffic accidents were reported in the city , but there were no serious injuries , officials said . At least five deaths in Alabama and two in Georgia were blamed on the weather .  Latasha Wade , 38 , said she was awaiting word of her 31-year-old brother , last heard from Tuesday night after his car was stranded in Atlanta .  " I do not know if he’s laying out in the snow or what , " she said . " It’s the most hurtful thing because I do not know anything that’s going on with my brother . "  The storm took a toll on air travel across the region , with more than 2,600 U.S. flights cancelled and hundreds of others delayed , according to           the ice and cold were the worst the region has seen in a decade .  Near New Orleans , sections of major roadways were closed , including the 24-mile Causeway Bridge spanning Lake Pontchartrain , and nearly a full day of flights were cancelled at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport .  Across the South , authorities appeared caught off guard by Tuesday 's storm , and were left to cope with its aftermath on Wednesday .  In Birmingham , Alabama , authorities said a lack of warning about the treacherous conditions led to thousands being stuck on roads , in shelters and in schools on Tuesday night . Snow-clearing vehicles were initially directed south of the city , where the icy conditions were expected to hit .  " We proceeded to have school and have people go to their jobs , " Mayor William Bell said . " When it came , it was too late . "  Forecasters predicted little relief to the unusual cold blast , with temperatures due to dip below freezing again across the Southeast early on Thursday . That           .  Nicole Lynch , 22 , a student at Kennesaw State University , was among the Atlanta motorists who found themselves stuck in frustrating traffic snarls .  " They should have at least warned any sort of road crew , or taken some precautions . They should have cancelled school a lot sooner than they did , " Lynch said . " It’s a lot of shudda , cudda , . "  A Facebook page called " Stranded Motorists Help Jan 28 , 2014 " which has more than 10,000 members , amassed entries from frustrated drivers and volunteers trying to come to their aid after the daylong gridlock in the Atlanta metro area .  Rachel Richter , 30 , said she finally abandoned her car , after sitting in a traffic jam for six hours .  " It was more the frustration that it was just complete gridlock . Nothing was moving at all , " she said . " You moved like an inch in two hours . "   Mobile Leaderboard  
 quite a bit about the Big Smoke from retired Canadian international Paul Stalteri , who he played alongside at Borussia Monchengladbach until 2011 .  " Michael and I shared many different conversations about football , " Stalteri told the Sun . " As for TFC , I always shared my views on the fantastic fans in this city and how passionate they are about nurturing a winning Canadian franchise . "  The dog and pony show MLSE had both Defoe and Bradley sit through made that abundantly clear .  " The thing they 've always told me is what a sports city Toronto is and how passionate and how much the people love their teams , " Bradley said of the above conversations . " I was able to get that sense right away .  " You 're trying to picture what life is going to be like on a daily basis . You 're trying to pick up what it’s going to be like to go into training every day . I was lucky in a sense that I had been there . I knew           . "  There were other conversations that needed to take place along the way .  His dad , former U.S. national team head coach Bob Bradley , was offered the head coaching job out in Vancouver this off-season .  The younger Bradley laughed when reminded both he and his pop were almost both this month .  " We have a very close relationship , " Bradley said of his dad , who was recently named head coach of Norway 's Stabaek . " To hear what he thinks about different things is always something I value . He’s similar to me . The chance to come to a club , to come and have to put a lot of responsibility on my shoulders , that’s what motivates me a lot .  " He and I had a lot of good conversations about this . "  Going back to naysayers south of the border , most wondered what current American bench boss Jurgen Klinsmann would think of Bradley leaving Europe for Major League Soccer .  With the 2014 World Cup five           in the two weeks leading up to the signing .  " Jurgen and I have a good , honest relationship , " Bradley said . " At a certain point , I felt like it was my responsibility to call him and talk through things with him so he understood the way I was thinking and what was going through my head .  " Jurgen wants guys on his team who are not afraid of challenges , who are trying ever day to improve . That’s what this is all about . "  Each of TFC 's new signings Dwayne De Rosario , Defoe , Bradley , Justin Morrow all say the same thing : A single sit-down with the club 's top brass leaves one excited to see out the vision TFC has promised fans over the last three months .  " To speak with the front office , you get a sense right away that this is going to be something really good to be part of , " Bradley said . " To come and help build something special ,           North America . "  Related  A 
 The Canadian Council of Muslim Women ( CCMW ) , a nominally liberal and progressive organization , recently completed its niqab study entitled , " Women in niqab speak " .  The study , sponsored by the Ontario Trillium Foundation , seeks to give a voice to women who wear the niqab .  Or , as I would put it , to women who isolate themselves from society by donning mobile curtains .  The study describes women wearing niqabs as " engaging " and " dynamic " .  Most of the interviewees , who adopted the practice after arriving in Canada , had a " high level of education " .  The study " represents an attempt to cast light on the existing agency of , and provide space for , Canadian Muslim women who wear the niqab to speak for themselves . " Professor Lynda Clarke of Concordia University penned the findings , which claim to challenge many " mainstream presumptions and stereotypes " .  This is not surprising since the study tried to vindicate the niqab by allowing those Muslim women who have           According to the study , niqabi women chose to wear the niqab for various reasons .  Of the sample of 81 women , only a small percentage cited coercion by a husband or male relative as the reason for donning it . The only surprise here is that anyone admitted this .  In fact , the study 's results were doomed to success for the niqab from the outset .  Naturally , the views expressed in the study would endorse the niqab in large part because it disregards the voices of Muslim women who have shunned face coverings .  Interviewing these women would have provided a more authentic and balanced picture of female attitudes towards these shrouds .  According to the study , only 44.7% of the respondents considered the practice mandatory .  The rest of the niqab-wearing women said they wanted to enhance their piety or express their religiosity in a socially assertive manner .  Some respondents said their husbands opposed the practice , and so they could hardly have been coerced .  The fact remains these women aspire to an           influential , men , including mullahs and ayatollahs . The niqab has become the standard only because men like these have defined it as such .  Indeed , it is only by promoting the niqab as a symbol of religious devotion and piety that the garb has gained vogue , even among those who do not deem it necessary .  The study obviously seeks to bolster a " " argument . It claims women don it of their own volition for self-study or serene introspection .  However , the study confines itself to one particular narrative of Islam , a narrow one that fundamentalists market aggressively .  The CCMW says it is liberal and progressive .  The stated purpose of the study is to create a better understanding of women in niqabs and to " build a more inclusive Canada " , hence promoting acceptance of the veil here .  It seeks to create tolerance for the niqab , perhaps in line with third-wave feminism , in which women should be able to define their own femininity .  However , this            It is not these women who have defined their identity ; they have simply aspired toward a standard of morality that has been articulated by men .  In presenting such a one-sided and rosy picture of the niqab , I 'd argue , the CCMW has done nothing but endorse a long-standing and baleful form of patriarchy.  Andrew Kostiuk , 
 upon 2,000-plus Leaf’s artifacts , arranged in displays that rival the Hockey Hall of Fame . But what Wilson values the most in his career collection are the 2,000-plus tales that go with every piece , from the Bob Pulford marble he pulled out of a Post Corn Chex cereal box as a kid , to the door of the old dressing room at Maple Leaf Gardens he bought , re-mounted and covered in autographs .  Without notes to jog his memory , the 59-year-old stockbroker revs into detail about all the sweaters , photos , trophies , plaques , contracts and intimate letters . While touching Gardens gold , such as seats , turnstiles and sticks , game-worn equipment and sweaters , Wilson chatters about how each item came to be in his midtown Toronto home his own treasures from childhood , those bought at auction , donated or in some cases stolen and surrendered years ago by those with guilty consciences .  " If there’s not a good story attached , I 'm not really interested , " said Wilson , whose room is           awaiting them in a Leaf’s afterlife .  " I 'm a Scarborough guy and I originally wanted a simple bar with a bunch of hats nailed to the wall , " Wilson laughed . " A place where I could come down with friends , drink beer and watch sports . Then it exploded into this and there has been no looking back . "  From the top of the basement stairs , where the ' lyrics ' of the Hockey Night in Canada theme song are framed , visitors descend the 14 steps , a little kismet with No. 14 Dave Keon , Wilson 's favourite player .  There’s hardly room for a TV when you get past a series of glass cases , paintings and framed sets of Leaf’s hockey cards , beer coasters , coins and the 1960s team photo calendars with a Cup usually in the foreground . There’s also a hockey library and an old reel of film Bob Baun 's ' broken leg ' playoff game from 50 years ago that Baun himself sold Wilson . Frank Mahovlich           dropped by to validate items , add to the trove or enhance Wilson 's yarns .  " Old Leaf sweaters are the hardest to find , " said Wilson . " They were passed along to new players in those days and when they did come available , they were often stolen .  " A guy had Max Bentley 's sweater and I was negotiating with him ( for ) about 16 months . He finally met my price , but only because he was buying a lot of Boston Bruins stuff what a traitor and needed my cash .  " A sweater from ' 51 came from a kid who walked in my office about 17 years ago . His grandfather was a friend of a Leaf trainer and had asked him for a sweater he could pass along to the family . You could tell the kid did not like sports and he just handed me the box . There turned out to be a Gordie Howe sweater in there , too , but absolutely moth eaten and destroyed . "  A           's way , years after a racetrack acquaintance of King Clancy and Harold Ballard received it from the Leaf execs upon the birth of his grandson . The kid grew up , hated hockey and auctioned it . Score another for Wilson .  When Mahovlich and wife Marie visited , Wilson surprised them with a pair of gloves the Big M wore for Team Canada . The couple was in shock all right , because they 'd gifted them years earlier to a home renovator , who promptly sold the mitts for huge profit . Wilson , who 'd bought them elsewhere and did not know the background , offered to return them , but Mahovlich said to keep them on show .  Wilson , who also purchased ex-Leaf’s captain Jim Thomson 's skates at auction , has found other relics just by poking around flea markets , garage sales and second-hand stores . Pulling off a highway in Wilkes-Barre , Pa. , one day after seeing a roadside ad for a hockey show , he happened upon ex-Leaf Chris Kotsiopoulos , who was signing items . At           in to see Canada play , he spotted an old man selling handmade Leaf’s figurines in a Russian doll design . He bought it , partner Debra stuffed it in her purse and it turned out to be worth between .  Before the Internet allowed people to shop from home , Wilson also frequented football and baseball memorabilia shows . He 'd feign interest in those sports , then carefully look for hockey items that were often tossed in at low prices . Daughter Andra and son Ryan soon took up his passion .  When he named Andra in the early ' 90s , Wilson was not aware it was the same as Kelly 's wife and Lanny McDonald 's daughter , but he’s proud she could recite the Leaf’s roster at age 8 . Ryan was a goalie for the Markham Waxers , following Mike , who was a minor pro centre in Orillia and Port Alberni in the Pacific Coast League , as well as stints in Italy and Sweden .  Some items came to Wilson end masse , as in the late           and stacks of paper files and contracts that Ballard never bothered cataloguing were simply designated for trash . Workers or carrion pickers carted many off , but Wilson and others re-claimed some unique documents through various channels such as a 1968 letter from Tim Horton 's wife blasting GM Punch Imlach for letting Leaf’s standards slip . Remember , the Leaf’s ' Cup drought was not even a year-old back then .  Another was from Imlach to Terry Sawchuk , that began ' What the hell are you doing ? ' Ordering the goalie to return a replica of the Cup he took from a team dinner . One note is from Jacques Plante , asking GM Jim Gregory for a new contract because he was in good enough shape to jog a mile . The widely circulated training camp schedule that Imlach sent to Jim Pappin in 1962 , telling players golf would be part of the itinerary , was originally Wilson 's find .  " Someone is out there right now with a whole pile of files trying to sell to me , "           I can display . "  But when Wilson was growing up , it was more fun to live the gilded age of the Leaf’s than document it .  " For my era , there was just Leaf’s and Argos , " said Wilson , the eldest of four kids in a hockey-mad family coached by parents Ernie and Kathleen .  " My dad went to St. Mike 's College ( home of many Halls of Fame Leaf’s ) and Saturday night in the early ' 60s was about going to someone 's house with a TV , mom and dad having drinks and the game on at 9 p.m. . I played , too , so the game became everything to me . But you did not think of souvenirs . "  That changed the day a friend gave Wilson a Carl Brewer game-used stick .  " I 'd take it on to the street and just lay it on the grass for the other kids to see . It was my pride and joy . Eventually , I did use it until it became           another 20 years . "  Then came a famous colour Libby 's Beans colour poster of Mahovlich in full flight . Wilson 's father had two properly framed , for Mike and Mahovlich 's dad , who ran the skate sharpening booth at Leaside Arena where Ernie played in the IBM company league .  " That’s where it really started for me , " Wilson said . " From them on , I had stuff in my room . I wanted as many hockey cards as I could get . I 'd flip them with my friends . I got the player coins from Salada tea , products , the kind you would play finger hockey with at the table or at school and the pictures on the back of Chex cereal . "  Wilson bought an unopened Chex box from the ' 60s with Imlach 's hockey tips , now valued between and .  " I 'd go shopping with Mom for Chex , though I did not even like them , " he confided . " If you got a           . "  Wilson 's obsession greatly distracted from his schoolwork .  " I was fanatical . I wrote everything about the Leaf’s . Career Day was about me joining the Leaf’s . My teacher sent a note home saying ' It’s too much , Mike has to talk about something else . ' My parents sat me down for a discussion . So, I wrote about Bobby Hull breaking the 50-goal record . "  With no trade shows back then to move or liquidate his growing Leaf’s assets , Wilson 's room was soon bulging with sticker books , programs , cards and pucks . Storage boxes followed him through high school , university , even his minor pro days .  " When I played in Vancouver , I still had pictures of the Leaf’s around my bed , such as Borje Salming . My teammates could not understand it . "  He put aside space in a condo , renovated the basement of his first house in Unionville , but both proved inadequate for all his prized possessions , which now included artifacts           and Notre Dame football .  " It got to the point where I could not look at boxes anymore , but I was not going to leave them in storage . "  Six years ago , he and Debra decided their next abode would have the collection as its centre-piece , a backdrop for many fund-raising ventures they 're involved in with Canadian amateur athletes and charitable causes , while keeping upper floors for family . They settled on a lot with a 1,000-square foot basement .  Designer Ariel Muller made Wilson think big , an intimate , version of the Hall of Fame . In the next 18 months , the basement was dug to increase height to nine feet , the foundation re-enforced , flooring and walls completed . Wilson does not want to get into what the collection is worth ( he’s never done a full inventory ) , but in case of uninvited company , there are no windows and four security cameras .  When the first-person Wilson hired to lay out the displays told him his ideas were           the guy that day " ) , he was put in touch with Scott Veber , who was theme expert at the Hall itself .  " He was this skinny little guy with a knapsack , who I first thought was somebody 's kid , " Wilson recalled . " But he started looking through my boxes and says ' This is awesome . ' He was here every night for six weeks , downstairs four hours at a time , doing one section then bringing me in to see . I only found later he was a Has ' fan . "  Wilson 's only request of Veber was that the 20 sweaters get main stage and that the room be bookended by a plaque of the 1954-55 Leaf roster ( the season he was born ) that once hung in the Gardens and the 1929 Notre Dame title banner . In between , he worked in Gretzky , Team Canada , the bar , a ring of armchairs and two TVs . Even the bathroom is with team pictures and a glass shower door with           Gardens auction in November of 2000 , hundreds of historical bits and bobs on sale .  " I started buying a few things , but then noticed a lot of people there were paying too much just to be part of it . I bought a 1930s turnstile for less than the most modern ones went for . The 11 Cup banners ( replacing the originals Ballard had trashed ) only hung there a few years , but guys were paying for them and ( ) for the ' 67 one . A head shot of Keon went for . Ridiculous . I knew guys were going to buy stuff in the heat of the moment , take them home and not know what to do with them . "  Many items came back in smaller , private auctions , which Wilson and others did get into . Wilson 's largest piece is the dressing room door , actually stolen by a worker then sold to a collector .  " I sat on those 10 years after buying it , but knew I 'd           locker stall ( with a Todd Warriner nameplate ) .  " Sittler once asked me ' what drives you ? ' It’s not the star power , that does nothing for me outside of authenticating each item . But each has to have a story and that’s why I do not mind showing it . For me it brings back the moment in time . "  For practical reasons , Wilson does not allow public tours , but says any former Leaf need only knock .  " I want every living Leaf to see this , " he said . " If we could have a big Stanley Cup celebration down here , that would be the best . "  Astonished guests come upon 2,000-plus Leaf’s artifacts , arranged in displays that rival the Hockey Hall of Fame . But what Wilson values the most in his career collection are the 2,000-plus tales that go with every piece , from the Bob Pulford marble he pulled out of a Post Corn Chex cereal box as a kid , to the door of the old           and covered in autographs .

It’s good that Canadians are saving , but unfortunately too few are making the most of it . Part of the problem is that many remain puzzled by the various investment vehicles available , and much of the confusion lays in tax-free accounts .  The BMO study found only of Canadians can identify eligible tax-free savings investments .

Investors should spend a bit of time learning the rules so they can take full advantage of this very useful investment vehicle .  Tax-free savings accounts can save up to per year , and unused contribution room can be carried forward indefinitely . Withdrawals can be made anytime in any           the following calendar year .  It’s important to remember that recontributions in the same calendar year count against contribution room and could cause over-contributing , which the Canada Revenue Agency penalizes .  They can hold investments such as mutual funds , stocks , bonds , and GICs . Many investors do not realize this and instead use them only for cash .  The cash earns tax-free interest , but the tax advantage is minimal in a low-rate environment . Tax-free accounts are best used for investments offering better growth potential . With income and capital gains accumulating tax-free , they are suitable for investments that otherwise generate greater total tax payable if held in a non-registered portfolio .  For instance , an investor who contributed last year , with the full amount invested in an exchange-traded fund tracking the U.S. , would be up by about . The tax-free profit would be . Compare this to the investor who left the contribution in cash generating 1.50% and earning only .  Although profit is an exceptional year ,           .  Consider an investor who puts into a tax-free savings account at the beginning of every year for the next 20 years , invested in a product generating a gain per year .  After 20 years , it would be worth . In comparison , if the investment was made in a non-registered account and taxed at a marginal rate of , the balance would be . The difference speaks for itself .  Since 2013 the contribution limits are per year , up from per year from 2009 through 2012 .

 One of the greatest things about this job if " job " is not too generous a word is that I get to talk to famous people about obscure stuff that I happen to be a huge fan of .  Like sitting down with Joss Whedon , director of the billion-grossing The Avengers , and asking him if his space western Firefly might ever be resurrected . ( He 'd love to see it happen , but it’s really unlikely . ) Or chatting with Guillermo del Toro , the man behind Pan 's Labyrinth and Pacific Rim , and wondering about a horror video game called Insane that he 'd been working on . ( It’s still coming , eventually . )  The opportunity arose again last week when I was interviewing Phil Lord and Christopher Miller , the directors of 21 Jump Street , Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and this month 's assault of animated awesomeness , The Lego Movie .  All cool stuff , sure . But what I was really dying to know was : what the           for the tragically uninitiated , was an animated TV series that debuted on Telethon in Canada in 2001 ( and occasionally still pops up in reruns ) and aired on MTV in the U.S. in 2003 , although MTV cancelled it partway through its first and only season .  The premise alone was brilliant : a shadowy organization samples DNA from various historical figures and creates modern-day clones , which , having matured into teens , attend high school together .  The humour came from the show 's rapid-fire dialogue , its tendency to riff on overwrought teen dramas and from the way the clones ' personalities clashed with what we know about their historical counterparts . Abe Lincoln ( Saturday Night Live alumnus Will Forte ) was insecure and clueless , Gandhi ( Michael McDonald ) a hyperactive horn dog , Joan of Arc ( Nicole Sullivan ) a goth girl , and so on .  Created by Lord , Miller and Bill Lawrence ( the guy behind Scrubs and Cougar Town ) , Clone High was a fantastic show that came and went too soon           the years since . So , any chance it could be brought back ?  " We talk about it regularly , " said Miller , adding he and Lord recently chatted with Lawrence about the possibility of doing more Clone High , perhaps even as a movie . There’s just one problem : MTV parent company Viacom holds the rights , " and they 're reluctant to really do much with it because they got into so much trouble before . " ( He’s referring to a protest in 2003 by 150 Indian politicians and activists , who were upset at MTV over the way Mahatma Gandhi was portrayed on the show . )  For what it’s worth , Lord and Miller included a tip of the top hat to Clone High in their new movie by casting Will Forte as the Lego version of Abe Lincoln . And there is one easy solution to bringing those sexy , angsty clones back , said Lord : " We need to get really , really rich , and then take an ownership stake in Viacom .           Lego Movie Blu-ray . Like I was not going to do that anyway .  FIVE GEEKY THINGS I 'M INTO THIS WEEK  Classic Space Lego  This week 's release of The Lego Movie could be a huge jolt of nostalgia for old Lego fans , thanks to the inclusion of Benny ( voiced by Charlie Day ) , an astronaut from the old-school space Lego sets of the 1980s . Heck , his helmet is even broken in the exact spot where they always snapped ! I have a feeling I 'm going to be this week on another quest to repurchase my childhood .  X-Men : Days of Future Past  Due to my staunch resolve to see this May 's X-Men : Days of Future Past with completely fresh eyes , I 'm avoiding all trailers , commercials and other teaser material . But with everyone talking ( or freaking out ) about the 25 Empire magazine cover variants featuring characters from the movie , it’s getting nearly impossible to resist . Still , I remain firm . I wo not even           Default  There’s been tons of chatter about this latest game from Final Square Enix , out this week for the Nintendo 3DS . To be honest , I 'm not a huge fan of the Japanese role-playing game genre gives me a Fallout or a Mass Effect any day but every once in a while one comes along that gets its hooks in me . And your ca not know unless you try , right ?  Justice League : War  With the Man of Steel sequel pushed back to 2016 , we 're going to be waiting a long time for any big-screen Justice League action . DC 's latest animated feature , out on Blu-ray this week , should help fill that gap . It’s based on the Justice League : Origin comic book series from The New 52 continuum , and includes that buzzed-about scene where Green Lantern first meets Batman : " You 're not just some guy in a bat costume , are you ? "  Rick and Morty  I 'm late to the party on           and his hapless grandson , co-created by Community 's Dan Harmon . But better late than never ! Unfortunately , it’s difficult to access the show in Canada the YouTube channel is deblocked , and it’s not on the Canadian iTunes Store but there are ways around that sort of thing for a scientific mind .  While it may be a teaser trailer , TV commercial or talk show clip that ultimately sells us on seeing any given movie , posters are a reminder that a well-designed image can capture a movie 's tone just as well as a slickly edited two-minute montage .  At a time 
 From a peninsula connected to the mainland at its extreme east end , it became a full-fledged , geographically correct island thanks to a series of violent storms that struck the city in the late 1850s .  ( For a full and fascinating account of Toronto Island history , read Sally Gibson 's book More Than an Island . )  It was not long before Toronto 's " new " Island just across the bay joined the other members of what were described in the tourist books of the day as the " lungs " of the city , along with several other green spaces such as High Park and along the banks of the Humber and upper reaches of the Don River .  After the narrow isthmus that had connected the former peninsula with the mainland was washed away by rushing waters of the Don River in full flood , access to the Island was limited to some sort of boat .  Of course , it was not long before a few enterprising entrepreneurs established privately owned companies to ferry citizens and tourists across Toronto Bay           usually the easy part of the voyage . Occasionally , when a heavy thunderstorm broke over the city , one or two of the less reliable ferry companies would refuse to honour the return portion of the passengers ' tickets , leaving them stranded hoping a competitor 's boat would return them to the mainland .  This problem was eventually resolved with the merger in 1890 of all ferry companies under Lawrence " Lol " Solman 's Toronto Ferry Company .  Interestingly , this highly regarded city businessman also ran the city 's professional baseball team , which played its home games at Maple Leaf Stadium at Hanlan 's Point , as well as the nearby amusement park and the Royal Alexandra Theatre up on King St.  In all matters , lol was a stickler for treating his customers right . No longer did storms leave Island visitors to fend for themselves . 's company was taken over by the six-year-old TTC in 1927 . The TTC added a fleet of 18 vessels to its roster of hundreds of streetcars and buses . Metro Toronto           took over ferry operations in 1962 .  On the subject of transportation , the wonderful new world of civilian aviation came to the Island in 1939 , with the opening of the new Port George VI Airport , a name selected to honour a visit that spring by the royal couple and the beloved King and Queen of the Dominion of Canada .  Toronto was late providing landing fields and terminal facilities for the fast-growing business of inter-city passenger flights . If fact , it was well known in aviation circles that Toronto was the only major North American city without a modern , fully equipped airport .  Sure , there were several local companies offering to carry freight by airplane from rudimentary fields on north Dufferin St. ( Barker Field ) and another near Eglinton and Laird Aves . ( Leaside Airfield ) , but the city itself had been reluctant to accept the concept of transporting passengers by air .  Finally , in early 1937 thanks to the prodding of a couple of forward-thinking city politicians and business people , including former mayor Bert           was commissioned . It suggested several possible sites for a civilian airfield : The foot of Coxwell Ave . near Ashbridge’s Bay , the foot of Cherry St. close to the Eastern Channel , and the sandbar at the west end of Toronto Island .  After much discussion , the latter site was chosen for a land and seaplane facility with the financing coming in equal measure from all three levels of government . The summertime cottages scattered along the sandbar , as well as the popular amusement park , obviously had to go . Many cottages were floated on the frozen bay to new locations at the east end of the Island .  By then the old amusement park had lost its charm having been overtaken by Sunnyside on the mainland at Humber Bay . Interestingly , while the waterfront location for an airport was an unanimously chosen site , officials also recognized fog and certain other weather conditions that often prevailed adjacent to Lake Ontario might make landing difficult , if not impossible .  As a result, a second " emergency " field was           It had its detractors because of its " impossible " location so far outside the city .  When it was determined the cost of purchasing the farmland for the secondary field exceeded estimates , officials decided to build each airport 's administration offices and passenger facilities from the same set of drawings . With the Great Depression still in minds of taxpayers , saving money was very much a fact of day-to-day life .

The gusts howl down the long laneway at Spurgeon Villa , a collection of modest older duplexes outside Chatham , surrounded by frozen corn fields .  The man ducks into a small office building that’s been converted into a makeshift synagogue and school for boys .  Lev Tahoor , a controversial ultra-orthodox Jewish sect , whose name means " pure heart " in Hebrew and is led by the radical Rabbi Shlomo , is making do here in a remote corner of southwestern Ontario , where           , an Ontario Court judge will decide if local child protection workers can act on a Quebec order to seize 14 Lev Tahoor children and put them in temporary foster care .  Quebec authorities believe the kids were physically and psychologically abused at their former settlement north of Montreal in Step Agathe-des-Monts , Que. , the sect 's home for a dozen years .  Lev Tahoor argues this is just another in a series of attacks on their religious freedom , with a secular state holding them to educational standards that go against their teachings and using their children as weapons in a battle to destroy them .  Dubbed the " Jewish Taliban , " the group has been maligned in Israel for its anti-Zionist stance and pegged as a cult .  In Chatham , local child-protection authorities have kept a close watch . Last week , Quebec police officers swooped down on the settlement armed with criminal search warrants for two homes .  After a two-hour search , they left without making an arrest .  An exasperated Mayer Rosner , 37 , a           have not been hurt by their parents but " are being abused by the ongoing investigations . "  " Each time they 're coming , we have to take a deep breath , " he said . " They 're looking for problems . "  They deny the laundry list of allegations told to a Quebec court a week after they left , including beatings with sticks , sedating children with drugs , arranged marriages for girls as young as 14 , neglect and poor education standards .  Rosner , Lev Tahoor 's media point person in Chatham , is anxious to show the progress the group has made in just two months .  School is going well , he said , as he whisks from room to room in the old empty offices to show off boys dutifully reciting their lessons based on religious texts .  Rosner walks back to his small two-bedroom home , forgoing an offer of a ride , explaining he ca not be in a car alone with a woman .  At the house , his wife , Malka           with their five daughters . All wear long black robes and head scarves .  They have nine kids . Their oldest daughter , 17 , was married a year ago and lives with her husband .  The couple say they 're coping after leaving an established settlement in Quebec , 800 km away , but it’s tough .  " We had our own bakery , our own grocery , our own school , our own synagogue , our own houses , " his wife says .  Rosner denies every allegation placed before the Quebec judge , including accusations the group is a cult , that it’s moving to Iran and has a suicide pact should things not go their way .  " It’s not brainwashing , " Rosner says , pointing to one of ' massive publications .  " This is the real way . Right now , we are a small seed . But a seed can grow .  " The world today is going down , down , down . He’s just saying he has the           education policies , the group says , are the real reason for the unwanted child welfare probe .  Malka said she was upset when a judge was told the teachings were well below standard .  " I was very insulted ... I was working so hard . "  They refuse to compromise on their curriculum . Any instruction about evolution or sex education is refused . In Quebec , the children were not taught French .  " Why teach the history of Canada ? " She says . " We are Jewish people . We are proud to live in Canada , but we are not proud Canadians . "  Whatever way the court rules Monday , it’s not the end of Lev Tahoor 's journey .  Rosner says they 're checking out other properties in Ontario for a permanent settlement . is expected to move to Ontario .  Rosner says that while Chatham has been friendly and sympathetic , nerves here are still frayed they are tired of the outside prying .  " We might close our doors (           welfare authorities . " The feeling we have now is , enough is enough . "  ABOUT LEV TAHOR :  Ultra-orthodox Jewish sect led by Rabbi Shlomo , 52 , who served two years in a U.S. prison for kidnapping a 13-year-old boy he was trying to convert .  ' Teachings reject the state of Israel , believing it should never have been established until the coming of the Messiah .  Followers believe in strict adherence to the Torah : They reject modern life , wear traditional dark clothing , follow a strict diet , marry young and speak Yiddish .  Homes are undecorated , without most modern conveniences , men are authority figures . Women are concealed in black robes .  After his U.S. prison term , was deported to Israel in 1996 . Weeks later , he was in Quebec claiming his life was in danger . He won refugee status in 2003 .  WHAT OTHERS SAY :  " Child welfare law applies whether you are a Jew , a Catholic           're ( suspected of ) violating the basic tenets of child protection , then the state has to step in whatever your religion . "  - Marvin Kurz , general counsel , B’nai Brith Canada  " My clients say religious intolerance drives the investigation ... they are saying that the actions of the Quebec children 's aid society were motivated by an intolerance to their religious belief . "  - Windsor , Ont. , lawyer Chris Knowles , representing Lev Tahoor  WE ASKED : Is Lev Tahoor 's quick exit from Quebec linked to that province 's drive for a secular state , including its proposed Charter of Values that would ban public workers from wearing religious symbols ?  " Certainly , here it’s believed that it’s closely related . On the other hand . it’s one of those cases where it’s brought some people to support the charter , " because of allegations not proven in court surrounding the treatment of children . " That’s sort of the way the issue is being seen here these           children . "  - Desmond Morton , historian , McGill University , Montreal  It’s not clear where the truth lies about the child-protection issues versus freedom of religion in this case , but Quebec 's proposed charter is sending a message . " Regular people that feel that religion has a particular role they want it to play in their lives , and that manifests itself in some physical way , are being communicated a particular message which is , ' We do not want that here .

 not pull any punches in December when the spoke of the " pervasive problems " of " " and " over-lawyering " in class action litigation .  Belo Baba dropped this bombshell in a decision considering the legal costs to be paid in a class action lawsuit .  He pointed out the process of examining docketed or recorded time to calculate the legal costs to be paid out of class action settlements encourages and .  Dockets are a lawyer 's time records . mean recording more time on a task than was actually incurred . It’s similar to a mechanic , for example , claiming it took two hours to fix a leaky gasket , when it actually took only 90 minutes , and over-charging the customer as a result .  involves putting more time into a task than it merits .  Not all lawyers engage in these dubious practices but enough do to have attracted Belo Baba 's attention .  The process of examining docketed time is also often used to calculate lawyers ' fees , as well as the winning one , in civil litigation .  If lawyers are engaging in these dubious practices in class-action lawsuits , you can be sure they are doing the same in other lawsuits .  Civil litigation lawyers have traditionally based their bills on their time dockets .  This often rewards the inefficient and the disorganized while encouraging lawyers to ramp up unnecessary fees by spending more time on a task than is warranted .  It allows lawyers to continue handling tasks better suited for paralegals or others .  Yet for the most part , lawyers continue to base their civil litigation fees largely on docketed time , and clients are forced to pay such fees .  We must step away from practices that reward those who incur more time in handling a file than those who handle it expertly and efficiently .  As Belo Baba pointed out in his decision " one imaginative , brilliant hour " can sometimes produce a better result than " one thousand plodding hours " .  It’s time we started to examine lawyers ' fees to determine if           Perhaps fees should be capped for certain services .  Why are lawyers allowed to bill their time in increments of tenths of an hour , often with automatic rounding up to two-tenths of an hour ?  Fees escalate rapidly with such docketing practices and often clients have little to show for them .  Why do we allow law firms to bill time for inter-office strategy discussions , thereby generating dockets by multiple lawyers ?  Why do we allow law firms to bill extensive amounts of time for legal research ? Some legal research may be warranted on some files , but for the most part firms that take on a particular type of case should not require extensive legal research to handle the case .  It’s true some lawyers , particularly those in the personal injury bar , along with some employment lawyers , have rejected time-based billings and have embraced contingency billings .  These lawyers charge a fixed percentage of the settlement or judgment , often between and .  Contingency billing favours clients who would otherwise not have the           but it is not without hazards .  There’s nothing to stop an unethical lawyer from encouraging a client to accept a quick and improvident settlement so as to generate a fast payout to the lawyer .  Also , there’s something slightly off when a lawyer is able to generate a quick , high settlement and thereby collect a large fee for a minimal amount of work .  Both time-based and contingency fee arrangements have their faults but the true test in every case is whether the client has received good value for the fees charged .  Lawyers must recognize that hours spent on a file do not always translate into value and that clients deserve to receive true value for the fees they pay .2271461  During a prolific 
 wo not really fool anyone . To great fanfare , the Liberal leader announced Wednesday morning " there are no more Liberal Senators . "  A few hours later , 32 senators emerged from a meeting to declare that , ( a ) they are still senators and , ( b ) they are still Liberals . Recalling the musician Prince , the legislators formerly known as " Liberal senators " would heretofore be known as " Senate Liberals . " Seem like a big change to you ? Us neither .  2 ) It does not really address the key problem they 're still unelected . In fact , Trudeau 's Red Chamber caper arguably makes the problem worse . Under his plan , unelected senators will now be appointed by other unelected people , in the way Orders of Canada are handed out ( you know , using the same sterling process that saw the Order bestowed upon Conrad Black , Alan Eagleson and David Ahenakew ) . Before , at least , there was a vestige of democratic accountability in Senate appointments . Trudeau 's           a bicameral legislature , with the government being called to account by the opposition . At different times in our history , when there has been a huge majority in the House in the Brian Mulroney era , in the Jean Chretien era opposition party senators fostered debate , and thereby democracy . Trudeau 's tour de force ends all that in the Upper Chamber .  4 ) What seems bold and visionary in opposition is rarely so when in government . When Trudeau is prime minister as he may be one day he 'd better get ready for the sort of gridlock Barack Obama was decrying in last week 's State of the Union address . There will be no more Liberal senators to whip . They 'll be independents and they will be working hard to live up to their name . Guaranteed .  5 ) The Senate scandal(s) ai not dead . If the Liberal leader hopes that his excellent Senate adventure will insulate him from coming expense probes , he’s been smoking something stronger than cannabis .  Ask           to mollify the RCMP or the media .  If Trudeau did what he did for scandal inoculation , it 'll be remembered as one of the most cynical political moves in a generation .  6 ) It was cruel and callous . In the " Senate Liberal " caucus , there are many hard-working and decent people .  Jimmy Munson . Percy Downe . Romeo Dallaire . Lillian Dyck . Marie Poulin . What Trudeau did was recklessly smear some remarkable Canadians with scandal . It was unfair and unwarranted , and its wo not soon be forgotten by many , many Liberals .  7 ) It was done without any consultation with party members whatsoever .  The only people in on the decision , ironically enough , were a puny group of unelected advisers , who thereafter fanned out to offer " exclusives " to the media about their super-important role in remaking Canadian history .  For a guy who promised no more top-down decision-making , the Senate gimmick was about as top-down as it gets .  8 ) It was a           up an identical proposal in the House . The Liberals , Trudeau included , sniffed that it was " unconstitutional " and voted it down .  What changed ? We can only speculate myriad horrors await in the auditor-general 's Senate expenses probe . They must be very big .  9 ) It cements the view that Trudeau does policy on the fly .  Like the summer lost to marijuana at the expense of any other policy . Like the ruminations about understanding the feelings of the Boston bombers , or admiring the Chinese dictatorship . All of it increasingly suggests Trudeau is making it up as he goes along . Not good .  10 ) In politics , all that matters is loyalty and trust .  Last week , Justin Trudeau merrily shredded both , and he broke faith with people who literally kept the Liberal Party of Canada alive when he was still in nappies .  Last week , Justin Trudeau looked like a participant in a Model Parliament .  Liberal leader looked like a participant in a Model Parliament            great fanfare , the Liberal leader announced Wednesday morning " there are no more Liberal Senators .

 LONDON , Ont. Already on edge , southwestern Ontario pork producers got another shot of bad news on the weekend after a highly contagious piglet-killing disease that made its Canadian debut in the London area was detected on a hog farm more than 200 kilometres away .  Officials have confirmed five cases of porcine epidemic diarrhoea ( PED ) in a 10-day period four of them in southwestern Ontario with the latest case found north of Toronto in Simcoe County , the Ontario Agriculture and Food Ministry said .  News of the disease creeping outside Ontario 's main hog belt raised fears the Ontario hog industry could go down the same road as its counterpart in the United States , where PED has spread to 22 states since first being detected in May , killing as many as three million piglets and driving up pork prices .

The disease has also been detected at an Ontario processing plant , assembly yard and a trucking yard .  Last week the federal government announced it will allow importation of a PED vaccine for use in pig herds as a precautionary measure .  Still in preliminary testing , vaccinated pigs have developed antibodies against the virus .  In a sign of farmers ' increased vigilance , there have been a number of suspected PED cases that have come back negative , said Susan Murray , a spokesperson for Ontario 's Agriculture and Food Ministry .  " There are other illnesses that can give pigs diarrhoea and vomiting ,           a number of negative tests for PED , so that’s good .

 - Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver used a hockey term Sunday to urge President Barack Obama to finally score with the Keystone XL pipeline after years of missing the net .  Oliver hit the airwaves to mount a re-energized government offensive to convince the White House to move after the State Department concluded the most reviewed pipeline in U.S. history meets Obama 's litmus test of not significantly exacerbating carbon pollution .

The State Department said crude was going to make it to market one way or another and that pipelines are far safer than transport by rail , which has seen tanker traffic surge because of a lack of           fifth such review since the first construction permits were sought in 2008 - triggered a 90-day period to allow eight U.S. agencies to opine on whether XL would be in the national interest .  Some , like the U.S. Defence Department , are widely expected to be supportive while others , like the Environmental Protection Agency , has said the review process was flawed .  " Now that the report is done and the State Department concluded that it would not have an impact , his criterion has been met and he’s free to conclude in the national interest that this project should be approved , " Oliver said .  The minister said that despite the three-month window for departments to weigh in and a 30-day public consultation , he said the final decision rests with Obama " irrespective of the process . "  The pipeline is widely endorsed by Republicans because of job creation and energy independence , but has caused rifts among Democrats , with unions in support and environmentalists opposed . Some aboriginal groups also want the project rejected .  Critics           to influential political donors and activist entertainers for stonewalling the 1,897-kilometre northern leg of Keystone from Alberta through Nebraska even after the initial route was diverted from an aquifer many states depend on for water .  The White House on Sunday also took to the airwaves with Obama 's chief of staff , Dennis McDonough , offering no timeline on when a decision would be made .  He told various political shows , including NBC 's Meet the Press , his boss wants to hear from the agencies first .  " He’s been very clear that he’s going to insulate this process from politics . We have one department with a study , now we have other expert agencies " ? which have an opportunity to look at this and make their determinations , " he said .  " The president wants to protect their ability to do that , make this decision based on the best analysis and most sound science . "  Quit ragging the puck , Mr. President : Oliver  OTTAWA - Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver used a           score with the Keystone XL pipeline after years of missing the net .  Oliver hit the airwaves to mount a re-energized government offensive to convince the White House to move after the State Department concluded the most reviewed pipeline in U.S. history meets Obama 's litmus test of not significantly exacerbating carbon pollution .

 whose children use or have decided to use her Eglinton Ave . W. tutoring centre have become more " informed " in their questioning about the math curriculum since the province 's Education Quality and Accountability Office ( EQAO ) released the results last summer .  Scott McMeekin , CEO of JUMP Math , which reaches 100,000 students across Canada , said at least the silver lining is that the results got a lot of people talking about " what can be done to improve student success rates " in math .  McMeekin said visits to their website from parents and teachers are up " significantly " and JUMP has been given more media attention since the results came out .  Those results show that , while reading and writing scores are holding their own , only of Grade 3 students met the provincial standard considered a " B " grade .  That’s down from in 2008-09 .  In Grade 6 , a mere of students achieved the provincial standard , down from in 2008-09 .  Murray           on problem-solving and the whole of concept of " discovery math " what the world is asking about math instead of the basics .  She tells the story of one parent really worried her daughter 's Grade 3 teacher had not gone beyond math concepts that got to the number 50 . When the parent asked the teacher why they were still at that level , the teacher said she wanted to make sure " every child has felt what 50 feels like . "  ( I 'll tell you what 50 feels like . )  Murray said the Mathnasium after-school program which is individualized based on each child 's weaknesses and strengths really focuses on making sure kids know the basics and are " inspired " by math .  " We do find the older kids really have huge gaps , " she said , referring to the Grade 9 students .  Each kid comes in for an hour once or twice a week to do their programs , they are regularly assessed and go home after each session with           , who was the head of academics at Toronto 's Bayview Glen private school before opening the Mathnasium franchise , worries that kids at a younger and younger age are using calculators in the classroom , and that " crutch " prevents them from exercising the " math " part of the brain .  " We do not let them ( our kids ) use calculators here ... we also have no technology , " she said . " It’s pencil and paper . "  McMeekin says JUMP Math , which provides a balanced approach that helps students understand math concepts while building basic skills , is actually being used as an in-class resource in Ontario classrooms .  " JUMP lesson plans show teachers how to explain concepts so they make sense , how to frequently assess student knowledge and how to make math enjoyable to all students , " he said .  Doretta Wilson , executive director of the Society for Quality Education , said tutoring has become a " huge , huge business " and in many ways the education system 's "           can afford to pay do and the ones who ca not , well they are the ones with kids who are struggling , " Wilson said , adding that Asian and East Indian parents hate what 's happening and feel the curriculum is " not stringent " enough .  She said the " hippy dippy " kind of education has trickled into the curriculum over the past four decades and every curriculum reform has unravelled because the education bureaucracy believes learning in math will just " happen by osmosis . "  The curriculum needs to be overhauled from creative problem-solving in the primary grades to making sure kids know " fundamental skills , " Wilson said .  The philosophy that " children learn by discovering for themselves " is entrenched at faculties of education and that , too , needs to change , she added .  Asked about the proliferation of centres like hers ( she’s about to open her second in the Beach ) , Murray said it’s because parents are not comfortable with how math is being taught in today 's           She’s absolutely in favour of the math curriculum going back to basics in Ontario .  " There’s been a huge movement towards this discovery-based learning but that has to be balanced with the basics and making sure kids can do things in their head without the use of their smartphones and their calculators , " she said .  Wilson agrees . She believes having students do things " manually " does help them understand math concepts much better .  " We 've all had the story of kids who ca not even count change without the cash register telling them what to do , " she said . " If you throw in a wrench ( like the proper change ) that throws them right off . "  McMeekin says math test results have declined across Canada ( except in Quebec ) and across most Western countries .  Wilson believes that’s because children are not expected to actually work hard for something .  " We have low expectations for our kids ... we provide them with all kinds of crutches ,           has to stop . "  Murray said parents whose children use or have decided to use her Eglinton Ave .

 romance department is heating up in Winnipeg . The city rose to the ranks of second-most romantic city in Canada , next to Victoria , B.C , according to Amazon.ca in their fifth annual ranking . A major jump from the city 's 11th place standing in 2012 .  The list was compiled by comparing Amazon 's sales data of romance novels and relationship books , romantic comedies , and romantic music discs from such crooners as Dean Martin , Barry White , Luther Vandross , and Michael Bubble .  Victoria finished first in the rankings for a second consecutive year . Niagara Falls , Lethbridge , Alta. , and North Vancouver rounded out the top five . Despite Match.com 's assertion last year that Winnipeg was the least romantic city , Amazon.ca 's findings seem to work with the city 's romantic legacy .  According to the online bookstore giant , it was the purchase of romantic books that put us over the edge . The company said that locals in Winnipeg purchased the most romantic print and Kindle books including period romance novels , gothic romance           local filmmaker Aaron Zeghers , who has spent the last year documenting Winnipeg 's historical love affair with romance and the romance novel . His film Born out of Love reveals the history behind the Harlequin romance novel published by a company founded in Winnipeg by Richard H.G. Bonny castle in 1949 .  " It was the beginning of the early form of female-dominated genres , " said of the publishing powerhouse 's legacy .  He views Winnipeg as a city of dreamers and romance as a form of escapism from the city .  " Seemingly , the romance novel is about adventure and going away from this world , " he said . " When you live in a small town , you can try to do other things , through the books . "  And just like

Canada 's players , including superstars like Sidney Crosby , Steven Stamkos and Jonathan Toews , will stay in the athletes ' village with the other members of the Canadian contingent .  On a tour of the village Tuesday , media were shown a room with three single beds in it , which will be shared by three members of Team Canada .  Canada 's chef de mission for Sochi 2014 , Steve Podgorski , said this is the way the players wanted it .  " No special treatment , " Podgorski said . " One of the things that we discovered in our exit interviews following Vancouver is that the athletes want to be part of a team . That includes the hockey players .  " They love it . It’s a unique experience and we talked about that . They found that to be of great value . They 're up in the athletes ' lounge           the other athletes . "  The NHL players will be among 110 Canadians staying in the coastal athletes ' village , while another 110 will stay in the mountains .  The Canadians will take up three buildings in the coastal region and all are within about a five-minute walk to the venues . said Canada got to choose buildings that were among the closest to the venues because they had the most gold medals ( 14 ) at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver .  " Canada won the gold medal count last time and for every country in the world except for Canada and the USA , that means we were the Olympic winners , " Podgorski said .  " That helped us a lot with the Russians in terms of where we got to live in the buildings . People love winners . That’s what we are . Everything matters . If you 're not doing well and you have not hosted the Olympics in 100 years , it’s not as easy . "  While the accommodations are not akin           during the season , they have plenty of amenities , including athlete lounges , a medical centre , a wellness centre , a gym and support staff offices .  Some even have a view of the Black Sea , but it’s still their location that pleases people the most .  " The accommodations are really quite nice but I think the biggest thing is the proximity , " Podgorski said . " You walk out a little walkway , hang a right and if you 've got a good lacrosse stick you can bounce one off the men 's and women 's hockey gold medal game arena . How good is that ? "  Raved about the Olympic venues , which were all built specifically for these games and are all clustered together within a few minutes walking distance of one another .  " It’s farther to the dining hall than to the venues from here ... it’s remarkable , " Podgorski said .  " This is amazing . There’s nothing like it and it’s pretty phenomenal . I           've got it all . "  Said another thing that makes the athletes village great is the prevailing feeling of confidence among the Canadians , who are predicted to win a national record 30-plus medals at these Olympics .  " The best part of it is , when you walk in here , you 've got a bit of a swagger going on because we are a good team , " he said . " We 've invested in our athletes and Canadians are proud of us .

 turns in uniform after years of pretending to be officer  Dave Banks , president of the Kingston branch of the Princess Patricia 's Canadian Light Infantry Association on Wednesday February 5 2014 holds up a captain 's uniform that was turned in by Carl Dale , who apologized for impersonating military members in Kingston . IAN AGENCY  KINGSTON , Ont. - After years of impersonating a Canadian military officer at events in and around Kingston , Ont. , Carl Dale turned in his uniform to military officials on Wednesday .  Dale met with Lt.-Col. Ron Bell of the Royal Canadian Regiment and was said to be remorseful for his actions and joining several veteran motorcycle groups under false pretences .  His actions were first brought to the attention of QMI Agency by several former military members , including Dave Banks , president of the Kingston Branch of Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry Association ( PPCLI ) and retired lieutenant-colonel .  Calls to Dale 's home on Wednesday went unanswered and messages were not returned .  Dale is the second fake soldier exposed in recent           22 for pretending to be a combat veteran . He was found out after making false claims on a Facebook page .  Last week , Dale was in contact with QMI Agency saying he was being harassed , bullied and threatened by someone in Ottawa over the issue and said that he was planning to consult a lawyer .  Dale admitted he was never a captain in the PPCLI , but claimed he had served in the reserves for five years .  " It was years ago , I 'm not any longer . That was not my career , " said Dale , who said he is a contractor .  A search of the PPCLI 's global database did not turn up anyone named Carl Dale .  He also denied wearing medals on his uniform despite a widely-distributed photograph showing him wearing one under his name tag .  But by Tuesday it appeared Dale had a change of heart and by noon on Wednesday Banks had received Dale 's uniform .  Banks said he became aware of Dale 's actions a few           in during military events without being noticed as a ' poser , ' pointing out numerous ways Dale wore the uniform and medals incorrectly .  Banks provided a variety of photos of Dale , most at military events . One photo shows him in a full Canadian army captain 's uniform sitting next to and holding hands with a woman in a wedding dress .  Banks said Dale 's tried the same tactics with other organizations for retired military members .  " He’s got a long history of being kicked out of other organizations for the same problem , " he said , pointing to the Canadian Army Veterans , also known as CAV , a motorcycle organization of retired military personnel . He was also asked to leave the Canadian Veterans Freedom Riders .  Impersonating a military member could lead to a charge of unlawful use of military uniforms or certificates . Banks said he does not plan to press charges , because Dale 's given up his impersonation and apologized .  However , Bill Finlayson , co-founder of Stolen Valour , which           file charges against Dale with the Kingston Police .  " After speaking with other members of Stolen Valour Canada we have decided to go against the recommendation of the PPCLI Association 's decision not to have Mr. Dale charged , and instead will be making an application to Crown ( counsel in Kingston ) to indeed try and have Mr. Dale charged , " wrote Finlayson , retired from PPCLI , in an email to QMI Agency  Canadian military imposter turns in uniform after years of pretending to be officer  KINGSTON , Ont. - After years of impersonating a Canadian military officer at events in and around Kingston , Ont. , Carl Dale turned in his uniform to military officials on Wednesday .

 massacre wants new trial  John ( Boxer ) , left , at Christmas 2004 in Toronto with Wayne ( Weiner ) Celestine , who was convicted last October of killing him and seven other Bandido gang members in April 2006 near Shedden . ( Courtesy )  LONDON , Ont. - The outspoken ringleader of a Bandidos biker massacre is seeking a new trial because his own outrageous words were used against him .  Wayne Celestine 's appeal of eight first-degree murder convictions is also based on the arguments he was not well served by his defence team and was the target of untrustworthy bikers eager to deflect blame .  " Providing ( Celestine ) with a fair trial was a serious challenge to the justice system and the trial judge . The charges in this case were shocking and the subject of widespread publicity . . . and ( Celestine ) was personally notorious in the region as a dangerous outlaw biker , " states the factum , the basic arguments , prepared for a court of appeal hearing scheduled for June .  Given the trial , it was key that Kellestine , also a member of the Bandidos at the time , get a complete defence that ensured the judge properly charged the jury before deliberations , the factum states .  In his charge to the jury , Justice Thomas Heeney told jurors they could treat Kellestine 's statements as further evidence of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt if they believed the statements were concocted on purpose , with that belief based on other contrary and independent evidence presented during trial .  Kellestine also says he " received little assistance from his counsel " on some issues and the judge erred on an important point in law regarding the killer 's own statements to police , his lawyer argues .  There’s more than a bit of irony in those arguments for those who knew or followed Kellestine 's career over the years .  did not shy away from talking to police in the past when it helped him , criminal and police sources said over the years .  As for the notoriety , Kellestine worked hard           his anti-gay , pro-Nazi sentiments in public , and creating a well-known biker hangout complete with giant logo on a barn , and engaging in violent crime .  For the past five years , Kellestine has been out of the public eye while serving life sentences for killing eight fellow Bandidos motorcycle gang members April 7 , 2006 , in an internal power struggle . ( Four of the other six men convicted are also appealing )  Seriously I 'll for a time , Kellestine has been busy being himself behind bars .  Sources tell QMI Agency has pushed to get out of segregation and has complained as well about the prison-issue clothing he has to wear when on appointments outside prison .

She said she did nothing wrong in relation to the scooter accident and is frustrated by the lack of communication from the Cuban and Canadian governments .  However , Davis 's close friend Danica Richard , who is in Havana with her and has acted as a spokesman for Davis while she was receiving medical treatment , said a consular official visited them in hospital Wednesday .  " She did not have any news , but she did say people in higher positions are speaking now and it has a lot of visibility , " Richard said . " The recommendation is for Justine to obtain a lawyer and your ca not bring in an international lawyer , you have to use a Cuban lawyer . "  Richard said they have been looking at getting legal representation , but only if Davis is forced to stay past Saturday .  Cuban government officials said they are still on the case .  " Our authorities are doing everything in           before Feb. 8 , " a spokesman the Consular Affairs in Havana told the Sun during a phone interview Wednesday .

That’s one of the things that’s made the company so successful .

He said the investigation is ongoing but foul play is not suspected .  In town at St. Benedict Catholic Elementary , the Canadian flag was lowered to half-staff in honour of the Grade 4 student .  Many students stayed home from school Wednesday because of the storm that dumped more than 24 cm of snow .

However , there are no immediate plans to talk to kids about the dangers of play in the snow .  " It’s Orangeville , so snow is a fact of life here , " Campbell said . " For now , we 're just focused on providing support to Zachary 's family any way we can .

Local Councillor Jeremy Williams , who was also Zachary 's soccer coach , shared memories of the boy on Facebook .  " My heart goes out to their family and all who are sharing in this horrible loss , " wrote Williams .

" Forever , she 'll carry a burden that the rest of us will , hopefully , never know . "  Some parents suggested the death serve as " an opportunity " to warn children and prevent future tragedies .

 story about dangerous binge drinking , my awesome nephew and my son who hates needles .  But let 's begin at the beginning with Neknominate , an online drinking game that has swept the globe in just a few weeks .

But University of Ottawa medical student Josh Stern , who , I must add with a proud disclaimer , is also my nephew , has decided to cut the silly binge drinking trend off at its knees .  In the past week , had reached Stern 's group of friends and in the flurry of Facebook postings , he knew it was only a matter of time before it was his turn to be challenged online . But he saw its potential to become something far more meaningful than a stunt to out-drink your pals .  He had stumbled across a YouTube video by Brent Lindeque , a young South African who decided to change up his Neknomination . Instead of drinking , he delivered food to a homeless man and then challenged his friends to create something positive with their nomination .  It was Feb. 2 , the night before his psychiatry and ophthalmology exam and Stern could not sleep . Inspired by Lindeque , the decided he should start a           I call it Feed the Deed , " he explained . " Instead of calling out your friends to drink insane amounts and one-up each other , why not try doing a good deed and pay it forward ? "  After writing his exam Monday morning , he bought sandwiches and filmed himself delivering them to several homeless people on the street . He went home , posted his video on Facebook and nominated three friends to do their own random acts of kindness . " Hopefully it will spread throughout the world , " he said .  He ca not believe the overwhelming response .  Within 10 minutes , he heard from friend Russell Citron , who had started the non-profit Kindness Counts Foundation and wanted to collaborate on .  In a few days , they 've uploaded 30 videos of good works on the Kindness Counts Facebook page and it’s growing exponentially . One man delivered flowers to his favourite sushi waitresses , another paid for worth of free coffee for the drivers behind him in the Tim Hortons ' drive-thru           given out at Warden subway station , and coffee and donuts delivered to a police station . Each nominee then names about three friends and challenges them to perform their own random acts of kindness within the next 24 hours .  Some of the call-outs have been ambitious Chris Hadfield , LeBron James and Ellen DeGeneres are among those who have been challenged to .  " We 're hoping to spread it as far as possible . We want to reach out to athletes and celebrities . I want to see big scale acts of kindness , " Stern explains between classes .  " Neknomination is all about peer pressure . You do not want to look like a loser and end the chain . Here it’s still peer pressure , but it’s in a positive way . It pushes people to do good deeds . "  Which brings us to my son and his long-held fear of needles .  He just got his 24-hour challenge from a good friend studying in Calgary .

 The Fraser Institute recently released its annual rankings of Ontario schools based on standardized , province-wide testing by the Education Quality and Accountability Office ( EQAO ) .  Predictably , private schools tended to rank highest , along with those containing the fewest English as a Second Language ( ESL ) learners .  The results showed improved literacy skills but a steady decline in numeracy over the last five years . This decline appears to reflect a disturbing teacher inadequacy in teaching basic math .  The improved literacy ratings also raise questions about just what EQAO tests tell us .  Do the highest-performing schools have the most students with access to private remedial help ? Do they have fewer students whose first language is not English ?  Literacy results may have improved across the board simply because students and teachers , respectively , have become better at taking the tests and teaching them .  Ontario governments have administered them since 1996 , so the procedure has become familiar by now .  It may be cynical to suggest these tests provide a skewed picture about           it is at least reasonable to question whether the annual cost of around million for tests in grades 3 , 5 , 9 and 10 is money well spent .  It seems wasteful to continue a process that at best provides a hazy picture of how schools are faring across Ontario . There are more efficient and meaningful ways of assessing student and school performance .  Teachers already test students on a much more comprehensive curriculum in ways that suit the diverse needs of the student population .  Existing assessments provide a much more detailed picture of how learning takes place , of who is succeeding , and why .  Children learn in different ways . The activities of any normal school year provide an immense range of opportunities from chemistry to music to cooking for assessors to evaluate student flair and commitment to learning .  Moreover , it is the responsibility of school boards to monitor school and student performance .  Boards should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses in their schools . Each board needs to           has endured crisis after crisis with regard to education funding . The unending tussle between the government and teachers has caused unsettling disruptions for students , especially in extracurricular activities .  The financial situation of school boards like Toronto 's is dire enough to merit widespread school closures .  In this economic climate , we should retain only what we know is necessary . It therefore makes sense to scrap a standardized testing model of doubtful merit , and channel some of that money into better extracurricular programs .  Part of the funding should also go towards better teacher training , such as for math pedagogy something we know is needed , without the continuing cost of EQAO testing .  School boards that perceive such a need can seek remedial help . These are the institutions where funds should be directed in order to provide students across Ontario with equal opportunities to learn and thrive .  Pressure on teachers to prepare children for EQAO testing should be alleviated .  Time is better spent in the classroom learning skills in an environment free of           be answerable to the community that funds them .

 recent study published in The Lancet revealed that the sex lives of women have become more adventurous over the past 20 years .  The study which surveyed 15,162 men and women aged 16-74 , found that of women have had same-sex dalliances - kissing , touching or sex - compared to just of men . While the number of men who have had same-sex experiences have stayed the same or decreased , the percentage of women who have had same sex experiences have risen by over the past 20 years .  From the overwhelming popularity of the show Orange is the New Black , which prominently features complex lesbian characters and relationships , to the film Blue is the Warmest Colour , which has garnered considerable attention for its fearless sex scenes involving two women ; female same-sex relationships have received a lot of attention in popular culture over the past year . However , is this a sign of growing acceptance towards same-sex relationships , or merely an indication that lesbians are " trendy " at the moment ?  As author Jen Sincero writes           Sleeping with Chicks , " many women have had a same-sex experience or fantasized about it . As she explains , " sex with women can be as deep as it is liberating . It allows us to break free of heterosexual roles and expectations and explore sex in a whole new way . The fact that I 'd overcome my inhibitions about being with women opened me up to trying things with them that I was too shy to try with a guy . "  A few years ago , I remember having this exact conversation with a good friend of mine . When I confessed that I 'd never so much as kissed another woman , she offered to kiss me . It was one of the best kisses of my life . We 're still good friends .  However , when it comes to same-sex experimentation , it’s not all sunshine and roses for everyone involved . As another friend told me over drinks a few weeks ago , it’s not uncommon for her to meet ( and fall for ) women who           to return to the " straight life " when they 've fulfilled the fantasy of being with another woman . As she explained , " I 'm tired of being someone 's experiment . "  Although it’s fun to get wrapped up in an episode of Orange is the New Black ( and maybe even fantasize about what it would be like to make out with Laura Prepon in a prison locker room ) , in real life there’s always the potential someone will get hurt .

 concern Phillip I. Nolan , 43 , who is not only an award-winning music teacher , but the drummer in Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's band Herringbone .  Prior to the new complaints , Nolan was facing 15 sex charges involving two girls from more than a decade ago . Police said Thursday they believed there could be more victims .  Investigators are also talking with someone who they are treating as a witness .  The investigation began in November , following a complaint of two separate sex assaults on minors by a man during his role as a Grade 7 and 8 teachers .  One of the alleged victims , who is now an adult , led to another possible victim .  Those charges five counts of sexual assault , five counts of sexual interference and five counts of sexual exploitation date back to incidents between 1998 and 2000 according to Ottawa police .  Court documents give a more precise timeline of when alleged attacks happened between Jan. 1 and July 31 , 2000 .  Nolan 's lawyer Lou Stress           himself .  Reached by phone on Friday , Nolan spoke French and hung up abruptly when given an opportunity to respond to the charges .  Bandmates were not available for comment , but Nolan 's Facebook page was no longer linked to the band’s Facebook profile Friday . In fact , Nolan 's Facebook page is no longer visible at all . The Herringbone band main website was also taken down by Friday .  Nolan was removed from the classroom , and put on administrative duties , when the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board learned of the investigation , and was suspended when the charges were laid .  He will remain suspended until the case is resolved .  Nolan appears in court March 12 , having been released on bail . He was ordered not to communicate with the two complainants and seven other people .  He is also not allowed to be alone with children younger than 16 , unless in the company of the child 's parent or guardian .

Fallon then sat in on drums with the Muppets to sing The Weight . At the end of it , Fallon got up , walked down the hall , and passed through a studio door with a sign that said , " The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon , " where all his friends were waiting for him and cheering .  That walk down the hall was a nice touch , representing both an ending and a beginning .  Jimmy Fallon always comes across as a genuinely nice guy . But given how endearingly rattled he was in his final Late-Night show , it makes me even more curious to see how he handles things a week from Monday .  '           , emotion note  the final episode of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon , which aired early Saturday morning on NBC and CTV , saw the host somewhat shaky with emotion . Perhaps the enormity of what 's occurring finally caught up with him , as he 's set to take over The Tonight Show , starting Feb. 17 on NBC and CTV Two .  The night began with Fallon playing guitar and singing On a Night Like This , with Buckwheat Zydeco and the Roots .  In his monologue , Fallon tried to quiet the extended standing ovation he received by saying , " I do not deserve it , the show 's not that good . "  Then he added , " I 'm really going to miss being on TV at 12:37 ( a.m. . ) . I 'll especially miss the battle for late-night ratings with my fierce rivals Craig Ferguson and the infomercial.

 of Canadian ironworkers who were replaced by temporary foreign workers at an oilsands project north of Fort McMurray , Alta. , have been rehired , the company said Thursday .  On Tuesday , the Alberta Federation of Labour voiced concerns that 65 ironworkers working for Joint Venture on Imperial Oil 's Kearl Lake oilsands project were replaced by temporary foreign workers from Croatia .  Alberta Labour Minister Thomas Lukaszuk said his ministry was informed on Thursday that federal Employment Minister Jason Kenney has asked for an investigation into the allegations .  " The allegations are very concerning , " said Lukaszuk on Friday morning . " Minister Kenney is reviewing this matter and then I will decide if there is any further need to get involved . "  Said the Temporary Foreign Worker Program helps relieve Alberta 's labour shortage , but only in job categories where the federal government is satisfied that no Canadians are ready to take the job .  " The program is not to be considered a source of cheaper or more convenient workforce , " he said .            displaced ironworkers . The company said it regrets its actions and acknowledges the temporary foreign workers should have been assigned to other projects .  Kenney spokesman Nick Kool bergen said officials will still review the matter .  " Those who are found to have violated the rules of Temporary Foreign Worker Program will be added to a blacklist and denied the ability to hire temporary foreign workers in the future , " he said .  The AFL said that the ironworkers would have been paid over an hour but the temporary foreign workers were going get an hour for the same work .  Harry , business manager for the Ironworkers Local 720 union , said first cancelled a call for two dozen ironworkers on Monday .  " Then on Tuesday , roughly 65 guys working on site were all brought into the lunchroom at 3:00 p.m. and management informed them that every one of them was getting laid off . No explanation or nothing , " said .  " We had a meeting the next morning and through our agents           going through training and replacing them to do their jobs . "  AFL president Gil McGowan said the Temporary Foreign Worker Program is often abused by employers and was designed " to undercut Canadians . "  " Increasingly , instead of being filled by Canadians , jobs are being given to temporary foreign workers earning as little as half the prevailing wage , " he said .  The company is a joint venture between Alberta-based Pacer and a Quebec-based . Pacer was established in 1996 and currently has million in construction projects underway .  The Kearl Oilsands Project is an oilsands mine near Kearl Lake in the Athabasca Oilsands region roughly 70 kilometres north of Fort McMurray.  Vancouver Canucks defenceman 
 the foreign testimony gathered in this case might not even make it to the jury .  " Whether the process to take evidence in this case can be said to be contrary to the principles of fundamental justice is something that will be evaluated by this court after the evidence has been taken , " Cournoyer said during a 30-minute ruling from the bench .  The Crown will make a formal request for a European commissioner to interview witnesses .  Both the Crown and the defence would submit questions from Canada , but in previous such collaborations , foreign officials reserved the right to decide which questions to ask .  The Crown also plans to request a video link that would allow the European proceedings to be monitored from Montreal , with appropriate translation . Magnotta might stay in his jail cell and watch the proceedings remotely .  Transcripts of the interviews would then be provided to the Montreal court .  Magnotta , who had no reaction to Friday 's ruling , was nearly unrecognizable in the glass-enclosed prisoner 's box .  He’s           in June 2012 .  He wore a long-sleeved blue shirt with a grey sweater tied around his neck . His jawline and neck are much fuller and he sports a moustache and goatee .  Magnotta is accused of first-degree murder , indignity to a human body , production and distribution of obscene material and threatening Prime Minister Stephen Harper and members of Parliament .  A video clip that allegedly depicts the killing was posted to the Internet and body parts were mailed to Conservative and Liberal offices in Ottawa .  HM Revenue &amp; 
 as head of Canada 's sixth largest city , Hazel McCallion admits she has at least one regret .  " We do not have an adequate transit system , " McCallion said . " ( People ) moved to Mississauga to buy a home of their own . The market determines that . Developers do not build something that people wo not buy ... Transit ca not operate with cul-de-sacs and crescents and that’s what people love . "  With less than a year left in her final term as mayor , McCallion sounds almost wistful . She said she has not had a whole lot of time to think about her legacy as she remains focused on the job .  Her main lament this day is gridlock and the difficulty of moving people , end mass through a city of 713,000 , once regarded as little more than a bedroom community for Toronto .  The city has an ambitious plan to build its transit system . A light rail line running north and south along Hur Ontario St. is in the design phase . Work has           the west end of the city to the east end . But , its wo not be done by the time McCallion finishes her term this fall .  Regardless , McCallion said she made up her mind four years ago after winning re-election for a ninth time ( she has been acclaimed twice ) that she would not run again .  Her announcement set off years of speculation about who will replace her . McCallion , like everyone else , is still waiting to see who will emerge to take a run at the mayor 's post .  " I did not want to wait ' tilt the last minute because that would discourage people from putting their name up , " McCallion said . " The citizens would not have an opportunity to look around and decide who they would like to have as mayor in the future . I think I was honest and upfront with the city and I 'm not changing my mind . "  McCallion said there is no heir apparent , no successor .  " Nobody           " she said .  McCallion insisted she’s not stepping down because of health concerns ; it just felt like it was time , she said .  " When I made my decision it was based on doing my homework and deciding I did not wish to continue as mayor of Mississauga even though I 'm in perfect health . It would be no problem to continue as mayor from a health point of view . "  Tom Urbaniak , a political science professor at Cape Breton University and author of the book , Her Worship : Hazel McCallion and the Development of Mississauga , called her an " enigmatic " figure who has changed with the times .  " In a city that has lacked a downtown core , with scatter neighbourhoods , with very few landmarks , Hazel McCallion is the historic landmark , " he said . " A historic landmark with spunk and life and verve . "  Born in the Gaspe region of Quebec , Hazel Journeaux was the youngest of five children . She moved to Toronto in the           McCallion , in 1951 . They married and moved to Streetsville , having three children . Sam died in 1997 .  Urbaniak said McCallion started her career in Mississauga politics in the 1970s when voters were tired of the town 's political class and their dealings with developers . She helped usher in a new era by launching a judicial inquiry and rose to power during that tumult .  Her leadership during a 1979 rail disaster , which required the evacuation of 200,000 city residents , cemented her status as a folk hero among the growing population .  However , McCallion has also courted controversy during her time as mayor . She ran into trouble three times with the province 's municipal conflict of interest laws . She escaped each case avoiding the most serious penalty removal from office .  Urbaniak said , despite the conflict issues , nothing has seemed to hurt McCallion 's approval rating . She netted more than of the vote in the 2010 mayoral race . As a result , her departure will create a political vacuum as none           household names in the city , he said .  " It’s entirely possible that a couple of dynamic outsiders could emerge , " he said . " This election is far from a forgone conclusion . We 're in store for some surprises . "  Urbaniak said the power vacuum could see a number of candidates seek the mayoralty and faced with hard decision .  " There is a very good chance her successor will be a one-term mayor , " he said . " ( They ) will have to live in the shadow of a formidable predecessor and having to deal with the fiscal issues and make some extremely difficult decisions about where to find the money . "  The prospect of retirement has not mellowed McCallion , whose temper flares at the suggestion infrastructure is crumbling in the city . Over the past two years , the city has assumed million in debt for road rehabilitation . Another million has been issued for bridge rehabilitation .  " Our infrastructure is not crumbling , " she said . " In           have not gone into debt before , to make sure our infrastructure is not crumbling . "  McCallion is mum about her retirement plans .  " A book is being written about me so I 'm researching all the stuff I have to hand to the writers . I 've got a lot to do . "  As for her legacy , well , it’s the people of Mississauga , she said .  " I 'm a people 's mayor . That’s what I ran on . I ran on the platform of people 's mayor and I 've tried to fulfil that throughout the years . My legacy is to build a city for the people . "  ********  The woman once thought to be a challenger for mayor 's chair in Mississauga says she has ruled out a bid for job .  Carolyn Parrish told the Toronto Sun she will not run for mayor this fall . Instead , she will campaign for a council seat in Ward 5 , after her bid for that job during a byelection           colourful former Liberal MP , has been a polarizing figure for most of her political career . Since her arrival in the civic political arena , Parrish said many thoughts it was a given she 'd eventually seek the top job .  " People have expected it of me since I left Ottawa and came to council in 2008 , " she said in an e-mail . " Big bad MP would not be ' just a councillor ' surely . "  Parrish said she enjoyed working in the ward , which can offer very tangible results in a short period of time .  " People mistake enthusiasm for ambition , " she said . " I 'm enthusiastic . But I 'm also a pleaser . Lots of folks wanted me the be interested in the mayor 's job so I gave it serious consideration . "  Parrish is perhaps best known for her criticism of George W. Bush in the lead up to the Iraq War in 2003 . She infamously stomped on a doll of the former U.S. president during a 2004 comedy           council in 2008 , representing Ward 6 . Throughout her term she battled McCallion , pressing for a judicial inquiry into the failed land deal which she claimed had benefited Hazel 's son Peter .  In 2011 , Justice Douglas Cunningham found Hazel McCallion " acted in a ' real and apparent conflict of interest ' " but ruled she did not technically breach the act .  Parrish was defeated by Councillor Ron Starr in the 2010 election and then narrowly lost to Bonnie Crombie in a Ward 5 byelection .  Crombie , a former Liberal MP herself , told the Sun last week she is contemplating a run for the mayor 's job .  Steve Mahoney , the former Liberal cabinet minister and provincial MPP , is also " strongly considering " a bid for the job .  ********  Mississauga Transit at A Glance  A light rail transit project running along Hur Ontario St. from Port Credit to Brampton is in a design and assessment phase expected to end late this year . The price tag for the line comes in at           build .  The Mississauga Transitway , a bus-only roadway , is currently under construction with four stations slated to open in 2014 . At completion in 2016 , there will be 12 stations running from Winston Churchill Blvd. to Renforth Rd. In all , the city 's portion of the project will cost million .  McCallion in the Courts  Mayor Hazel McCallion has had three serious brushes with the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act .  McCallion was found guilty in 1982 of contravening the act but hung on to her job because the judge found her conflict of interest had been an error of judgment .  In 2011 , a Mississauga judicial inquiry found she 'd violated the spirit of the law by using her office to strong arm people to move along a project proposed by her son Peter , but technically it was ruled she had not breached the act .  A judge dismissed a case in 2013 where it was alleged McCallion voted on a bylaw amendment that could potentially have saved her son million . The case was           McCallion had nothing financially to gain from the vote .  Mississauga 's people will be her lasting legacy : Hazel McCallion  After 35 years as head of Canada 's sixth largest city , Hazel McCallion admits she has at least one regret .  " We do not have an adequate transit system , " McCallion said . " ( People ) moved to Mississauga to buy a home of their own . The market determines that .

 , Ontario 's Liberal government reversed a ruling of the Ontario Court of Appeal and made it harder for auto accident victims to obtain benefits .  This attack on no-fault accident benefits was accomplished through a regulation , a cabinet decree , made Dec. 11 and printed in the Ontario Gazette Jan. 4 . The changes came into force Feb. 1 .  There was no public debate , consultation or advance warning .  One change impacts the ability of accident victims to access more than in medical/rehabilitation benefits .  When the government reduced accident benefits in 2010 , it created a category of minor injury claimants who were limited to a maximum of in medical/rehabilitation benefits . The actual limit is much lower , however , since the includes the cost of medical assessments .  But the minor injury rules were set up with a safety valve . Victims could access up to in medical/rehabilitation benefits if their health practitioner established they had a pre-existing medical condition that would prevent them from achieving maximal recovery if they were subject to the           that safety valve has been limited so it applies only to pre-existing medical conditions that had been documented by a health practitioner prior to the accident .  This will reduce the number of people who qualify for more than in medical/rehabilitation benefits .  The FAIR Association of Victims for Auto Insurance Reform estimates about of accident victims are only covered for the in benefits so it does not appear there was a pressing need for this change .  Certainly, there was no need for it to be done without public consultation .  The other change is more insidious as it overruled a July , 2013 decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal involving payments of attendant care benefits to family members of accident victims .  Attendant care benefits are only provided if certified as necessary by an occupational therapist or a nurse . Insurers have the right to challenge any attendant care needs that have been certified as necessary .  The Court of Appeal decision involved a young male rendered paraplegic following a car accident . His attendant care needs were           conceded the attendant care needs were reasonable and necessary .  Instead of hiring full-time caregivers , the mother gave up full-time paid employment , where she earned per month , to provide care for her son on a 24-hour-per-day basis .  The insurance company took the position it was only responsible to compensate for attendant care benefits up to per month , the amount the mother gave up by staying home to look after her son .  The Ontario Court of Appeal disagreed , ruling the law was clear ; the insurance company was required to pay per month for the attendant care benefits .  That decision has now been over-turned . As of Feb. 1 , attendant care benefits are capped by the economic loss sustained by the care provider . Of course , the cap wo not be increased if the care provider gives up a salary in excess of per month .  This change will mean more heartache for families of catastrophically impaired accident victims .  Having family members provide attendant care is often beneficial for           the low rates allowed in the accident benefits schedule .  According to personal injury lawyer Darcy Mercury , this change " discriminates against persons not currently in the workforce , like retirees , stay-at-home parents , and the unemployed , who are restricted from being compensated for providing needed and valued care to their seriously injured loved one .

 husband has owned and operated a car wash in the GTA for more than 30 years .  She said more often than not her husband works seven days a week , " even Christmas Day , " and does not take a holiday .  While they 've made a living wage over the years , the couple has not eked out enough to set money aside in an RRSP or a Tax-Free Savings Account ( TFSA ) .  Now as they consider selling the business , they 're really concerned about where they 'll invest the proceeds and whether they 'll be at the mercy of the volatile stock market .  " We 're not going to be on a defined pension like my next-door neighbour who is a bus driver , " she said .  Fedora thinks many private sector employees are getting to the tipping point where they can no longer sustain the tax burden that pays for the high wage packets , benefits and pensions provided to those in the public sector .  " They ( the wages and benefits ) have           " she added .  Dan Kelly , president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business ( CFIB ) , said he’s concerned about the " societal dislocation " that will occur when private sector employee’s ca not afford to retire at 65 but see that their neighbours leaving the workforce at 57 and spending winters in Florida because they worked for the government .  " I really worry that the fabric of our country will start to pull apart because the jealousies between one group and another will be pretty enormous , " he said .  " The new rich are often public servants who are in much better financial shape than the average Canadian , " Kelly added .  Indeed, they are .  Studies from both the CFIB and the Fraser Institute , a public policy think-tank based in Vancouver , show a consistently significant gap , not just between private and public sector wages , but with respect to the benefits and perks , as well .  In its February 2013 Ontario Prosperity Initiative report , the Fraser Institute           a whopping 13.9% more in 2011 than their private sector counterparts doing similar jobs .  But as the Fraser report emphasizes , if public sector wages are rich , the benefits and perks of the job are out of this world .  According to the report , as of 2011 , 76.5% of Ontario public sector workers were covered by a registered pension plan compared to only of those employed in the private sector .  The Fraser Institute report also shows public sector workers are retiring at least 1.3 years earlier than their private sector counterparts and despite their complaining , civil servants have been pretty much insulated from job losses and layoffs .  " When you take those non-wage benefits combined with the wage premium ( of 13.9% ) , the picture is one that government workers are getting paid a lot more to do the same positions in the private sector , " said Charles Lamma , resident scholar in economic policy with the Fraser Institute .  " It’s hard for people to justify this kind of discrepancy and the wage           Canadian Union of Public Employees ( CUPE ) tried . In a confusing December 2011 study of their own prepared by a senior CUPE economist the union claimed , and not surprisingly , there was no evidence that average pay in the public sector is significantly higher than similar occupations ( not jobs ) in the private sector .  The CUPE study only peripherally touched on benefits and pensions , noting public sector employees do better because they work for larger employers , who offer more perks .  Both Kelly and Lamma maintain this was CUPE 's attempt to discredit a body of studies that consistently show the same results .  In fact , CFIB 's most recent Wage Watch report done in 2008 looks at unpaid benefits , such as the average actual work week , as well . when astonishing individuals are honoured .  " Kudos to Andy . He is proud of his Italian heritage as well as his Canadian heritage , " Demonte’s said .  On Wednesday evening , Donato was honoured at a gala event at the Riviera Parque Convention in Concord .  Donato 's fellow inductees into the Italian Walk of Fame this year include actor Joe Mantegna , musician Gino Vannelli and international union leader Joseph S. Mancinelli .  Mantegna said Toronto has been like a second home for the past 25 years .  " I grew up in an Italian neighbourhood in Chicago and I know this city as well as my hometown . I have travelled the world and I describe Chicago as the Canada of America , " Mantegna said .  Vannelli said learning of the award made him feel like a " little kid . "  " Seeing everyone here makes it real . This is an excuse for a party , " Vannelli said .  Editorial Cartoonist Andy Donato of the Toronto Sun ( L ) is inducted into the           2014 .
